        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A product manager (PM) is a professional role that is responsible for the development of products for an organization, known as the practice of product management. Product managers own the product strategy behind a product (physical or digital), specify its functional requirements, and manage feature releases. Product managers coordinate work done by many other functions (like software engineers, data scientists, and product designers), and are ultimately responsible for product outcomes.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A product manager considers numerous factors such as the intended customer or user of a product, the products the competition offers, and how well the product fits with the company's business model. The scope of a product manager varies greatly, some may manage one or more product lines and others (especially in large companies) may manage small components or features of a product.</p>
        <br>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the financial services industry (banking, insurance, etc.), product managers manage financial products (for example, credit card portfolios), their profit and loss, and also determine the business development strategy.</p>  

        <br>

            <li><b>User-Centered Design:</b>&nbsp;PMs advocate for users by incorporating feedback and usability insights into product development. They ensure that the final product meets customer expectations and provides a positive user experience.</li><br>
            <li><b>Cross-Functional Collaboration: </b>&nbsp;PMs facilitate communication and collaboration between different teams involved in product development. They coordinate workflows, resolve conflicts, and ensure that everyone is working towards a common goal.</li><br>
            <li><b>Market Understanding:</b>&nbsp;PMs conduct market research and competitive analysis to identify opportunities and threats. They stay updated on industry trends and customer preferences to make informed decisions.</li><br>
