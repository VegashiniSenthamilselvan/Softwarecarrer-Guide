            <br>  
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they fall under the same umbrella in web design, user experience (UX) and user interface (UI) are two terms that are frequently used interchangeably despite their different purposes and definitions. For aspiring designers, understanding these distinctions are key in establishing general web development knowledge, honing applicable skills, and breaking into the UX/UI design field. 

                In this guide, we will discuss UX design at length, exploring the primary differences between UI and UX, and what designers do for organizations around the world. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What Is UX Design?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;User experience (UX) refers to the user’s journey when interacting with a product or service. UX design is the process of creating products or services that provide meaningful experiences for users, involving many different areas of product development including branding, usability, function, and design. </p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One way to think of UX design is to consider the entire process or journey a user experiences when interacting with a product or service. How is the user introduced to the service or product — through advertising, blogs, or something else? What kind of interaction does the user have with the brand? How does the user feel after the interaction? All of these questions and more are key considerations within UX design. </p><br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A UX designer’s primary goal is for each user to have a positive interaction with a product or service. Whether the interaction solves a problem, provides entertainment, or helps the user find critical information, the experience should leave the user feeling fulfilled. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What Is UI Design?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UI design, on the other hand, refers to the actual interfaces with which users engage. The UI design process may include buttons or widgets, text, images, sliders, and other interactive elements. UI designers ensure that every visual element, transition, and animation included within a product or service is setting the stage for a fluid, positive experience. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Key Differences Between UX and UI Design</h3>
                <br>
                <center>
                    <img src="https://usa.bootcampcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/108/2021/08/Key-differences-ux-ui-design.jpg" style="height: 500px; width: 500px;">

                </center>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since UX and UI designers often work closely together, it’s common for UX and UI to be confused with one another — even though they represent different components of a product or service’s design. While there is some overlap between the two roles, there are several key differences to consider.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Look vs. Feel</h3>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UX and UI design play related, but different roles in a product’s development. UI design involves the look of a product — namely, the visual components and interactive elements that contribute to a strong user experience. Meanwhile, UX design focuses on the overarching feel of the product or service and the components that will lead to a meaningful, relevant experience for users. </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Design vs. Prototyping</h3>
                <p>&nabla;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UX and UI designers might work on the same product, but they have different duties and goals. UX designers often create wireframes and testable prototypes that form the basis of a website or service’s user flow, while UI designers finalize products and designs that drive user engagement. </p>
                <br>
                
                <h3>High-Level vs. Details</h3>
                <p>&nabla;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another difference between UI and UX designers is the level of detail that goes into their work. UI designers work on individual pages, buttons, and interactions; making sure they are polished and functional. UX designers take a more high-level view of a product or service, ensuring the collective user flow of a site, service, or app is fully realized and consistent.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>UX and UI Design Together. How Does it Work?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though they comprise different responsibilities, UX and UI make up a site or application’s entire usability design process. In tandem, these professions are complementary contributors to a positive, intuitive user journey. A site or application’s UX elements (e.g., client-facing messaging and feel), are built on top of its UI design (e.g., technical, aesthetic structure). Each profession’s efforts inform those of its counterpart, benefiting the overall product or service and making a lasting impression on users.</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Why Is it Important to Know Both UX and UI?</h3>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Due to their complementary roles in web development, UI and UX design skills naturally relate to one another. By having a working knowledge of both concentrations, professionals in either discipline can contribute to a more cohesive, transparent design process that leads to a better, more usable final product. Such versatility is also beneficial for those looking to increase their hiring potential in a variety of design-based roles. </p>
                <br>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Specifically, UX design skills are in high demand globally. According to the UX Design Institute, 70 percent of managers are increasing the size of their design team in 2021. A strong understanding of both UX and UI design can aid those looking to capitalize on this growing demand.</p>
